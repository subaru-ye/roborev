title: Agent Hook
description: Bring background roborev findings back into active coding-agent sessions
---

`roborev agent-hook` connects roborev's asynchronous reviews to coding-agent
harness hooks. It records shell-tool and stop events, checks for open failed
reviews, and reminds the active agent to fix them before the session goes cold.

The integration supports every profile in
[`go.kenn.io/kit/agenthook`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.kenn.io/kit/agenthook):

- Claude Code
- Codex
- GitHub Copilot CLI
- Cursor
- Factory Droid
- Gemini CLI
- Hermes Agent
- Qwen Code

Kit owns each harness's native config format, event names, command quoting,
payload normalization, and response encoding. Roborev owns only installed-agent
selection, reminder policy, and local session state.

!!! note

    This differs from [Review Hooks](/docs/guides/hooks/), which run your own shell
    commands when a review completes. Agent Hook plugs into the coding agent's hook
    system to steer the active session itself.

## The Loop

Agent Hook tracks three signals per session:

- **Turns:** `Stop` events, for periodic repair during long sessions.
- **Commits:** normalized shell `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` events. Kit maps
    each harness's native shell tool to the common `Bash` vocabulary.
- **Failed reviews:** open, non-closed roborev reviews with a failed verdict.

Roborev scopes commit and failed-review accounting to repository lineage, so
activity in one worktree does not consume another worktree's reminder. Outside a
tracked git repository the hook returns an empty native response.

### Review guidelines are required

Agent Hook never sends a reminder in a repository that has no review guidance of
its own. The daemon reads the same repository guidance that reviews use:
`review_guidelines` in `.roborev.toml` on the default branch, or a root
`REVIEW.md` when `review_guidelines` is unset. Global `review_guidelines` in
`~/.roborev/config.toml` do not count, because they are not tuned to the
repository. Without guidance, the hook behaves as if the checkout were
[snoozed](#snoozing-reminders): baselines advance, reminders never build up, and
adding guidance later does not cause a burst of catch-up reminders.

The rule exists because the agent fixes what the reviewer flags. A reviewer
without project guidance flags generic concerns, such as defensive checks, extra
abstraction, and unlikely edge cases, and a hook-driven agent that fixes all of
them overengineers the code. Guidance alone does not prevent this; tune it on
real reviews before relying on the hook. See
[Review Guidelines](configuration.md#review-guidelines) for the options.

The default instruction names the exact review job IDs and invokes the
`roborev-fix` skill for only those jobs. It never runs `roborev fix --open` or
discovers additional reviews. The skill treats every finding as an unverified
claim. It documents and closes invalid findings without changing code. It fixes
and verifies valid findings that fall within the current task. It leaves valid
out-of-scope or unclear findings open until the user gives direction.

Delivered review IDs are acknowledged in the Agent Hook daemon's session state,
scoped to the repository lineage. They do not trigger another reminder in that
session, while newly created review IDs still do. Deferred reminders acknowledge
their IDs only when delivered.

`instruction` is a complete override. Custom instructions are emitted without
the built-in scope or continuation guidance. When a reminder starts a fix
session, roborev adds the required completion command after the custom
instruction.

### Coordinating hook-triggered fixes

Agent Hook allows one active fix session for each physical worktree. The daemon
records the owner as the agent profile and harness session ID when it delivers a
reminder. Other sessions receive no duplicate fix instruction while that owner
remains active. The ownership follows that worktree across branch switches and
detached HEAD transitions. Separate worktrees remain independent.

Each delivered instruction includes its exact completion command:

```bash
roborev agent-hook fix-done [--roborev-server <address>] <fix-session-id>
```

When the hook uses `--roborev-server` or `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_ROBOREV_ADDR`, the
emitted command includes the resolved address. Completion therefore reaches the
daemon that granted ownership rather than the daemon found through runtime
discovery.

The bundled `roborev-fix` skill runs that command after its final review audit,
including when no code changed or an out-of-scope finding remains open. The
command releases ownership immediately. Repeating it for the same current fix
session is safe, while an old ID cannot release a newer owner.

If the owner reaches a normal `Stop` event before completion, Agent Hook blocks
with a reminder naming the original review job IDs and the same completion
command. The IDs are saved with the fix session and survive daemon restarts; new
reviews do not expand an active session. For sessions created before this state
included review IDs, the skill uses the original IDs from conversation context.
Recursive Stop events remain skipped. Ownership also expires 12 hours after
delivery. Hook activity does not extend that fixed period.

This coordination applies only to Agent Hook reminders. Direct human invocations
of `roborev fix` or the `roborev-fix` skill do not create or check a fix
session.

When a reminder triggers for a supported agent, the hook compares that agent's
installed `roborev-fix` skill with the version embedded in the running roborev
binary. If the skill is missing or outdated, the reminder begins with a warning
to run `roborev skills install`. The original instruction and its exact review
job IDs are still delivered. The hook never updates skills automatically.

## Install

Install hooks for every locally detected coding agent:

```bash
roborev agent-hook install
```

An agent is detected when its executable is on `PATH` or its config directory
already exists. The executable candidates are `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`,
`agent` (Cursor), `droid`, `gemini`, `hermes`, `qwen`, `grok`, and `zcode`.

Select one profile or deliberately install all ten integrations (the eight kit
profiles plus Grok Build and ZCode):

```bash
roborev agent-hook install --agent qwen
roborev agent-hook install --agent all
```

Use one uniform config override when selecting exactly one agent:

```bash
roborev agent-hook install --agent hermes --config ~/.hermes/config.yaml
```

Automatic and `all` installs attempt every selected profile and report all
errors after preserving successful installs. `--dry-run` plans the same changes
without writing.

For every supported agent, installation also creates or updates that profile's
bundled roborev skills before activating the hook. Pass `--mcp` to install MCP
configuration and MCP skill instructions together. The default transport is
stdio; use `--mcp-transport http --mcp-url <daemon URL>/mcp` for an existing
daemon endpoint. See [MCP setup](integrations/mcp.md).

Factory Droid remains user-scoped. Roborev rejects project `.factory/hooks.json`
paths because they are executable repository-local configuration.

ZCode registers hooks in `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` under `hooks.events` and
sets `hooks.enabled` to `true` because ZCode configuration-file hooks stay
disabled until that flag is set. ZCode follows the Claude Code hook input and
output protocol, so a `Stop` hook blocks the stop with the reminder text as the
reason.

Agent Hook uses the same stable binary resolver as `roborev init`. Pin a shim or
binary explicitly when needed:

```bash
roborev agent-hook install --binary ~/.local/share/mise/shims/roborev
```

On Windows, generated Claude Code hook commands use Git Bash-compatible quoting,
including for Scoop installation paths.

`--command` supplies one complete command for an explicit profile. It must
directly invoke `agent-hook run` and select exactly one matching `--agent`;
shell pipelines, chaining, command substitutions, and wrappers are rejected.
Roborev adds its ownership marker before installation. `--command` cannot be
combined with `--binary`.

### After upgrading

Check the version selected by the configured hook command, not just the version
of a newly downloaded binary. Version-manager shims may still select an older
installation. Check the running daemon's version through `/api/status` too.

Run `roborev agent-hook install --agent <profile> --dry-run` using the intended
installed binary and the existing `--config`, `--binary`, and MCP options. Then
repeat without `--dry-run` to refresh the registration and bundled skills.
`roborev skills install` updates only skills. Reinstalling a hook that uses a
shim does not change the version selected by that shim.

A daemon restart is a separate operation. Agents must follow local approval
rules before restarting an existing daemon. `roborev status` can automatically
restart a daemon whose version differs from the CLI.

## Declarative Config

`dump` requires one profile and writes the complete planned native config to
stdout without modifying the file:

```bash
roborev agent-hook dump --agent codex
roborev agent-hook dump --agent qwen
roborev agent-hook dump --agent hermes
```

JSON-backed harnesses produce JSON. Hermes produces YAML. Use `--config` to
merge an existing file into the plan. Binary-resolution diagnostics stay on
stderr so stdout remains safe to pipe into declarative configuration tooling.

## Runtime Model

Installed commands identify their profile and carry an internal ownership
marker:

```bash
roborev agent-hook run --agent <profile>
```

`run` rejects commands without the installed ownership marker. If this happens,
edit the agent's hook config and remove the `roborev agent-hook run` command
that does not contain `--source=roborev-agent-hook`. Then run
`roborev agent-hook install`. The installer does not keep rules for recognizing
or removing old registrations.

Current commands require `--agent`, read one finite native hook payload from
stdin, pass it through kit's typed dispatcher, post a normalized request to the
regular roborev daemon, and let kit encode the native response.

The regular daemon loads and persists session accounting and delivered review
IDs at:

```text
${ROBOREV_DATA_DIR:-~/.roborev}/agent-hook/state.json
```

The same process reads repository registration, review jobs, verdicts, and
workspace snoozes from the review database. Hook communication fails open: a
diagnostic goes to stderr and the harness receives an empty native response.
Invalid native payloads or unsupported profile names remain normal CLI errors.
If the JSON snapshot is unreadable, only Agent Hook event, status, and reset
operations are unavailable; review and queue APIs continue to run, and roborev
does not overwrite the unreadable file. Repair or remove the file, then restart
the regular daemon to load it again.

Persisting reminder state is the at-most-once delivery boundary. Cancellation
observed before that commit leaves a reminder queued; a disconnect after the
commit can consume it because coding-agent hook protocols do not acknowledge
receipt.

### Hermes

Hermes observes post-tool events but cannot inject control output there. When a
post-tool threshold fires, roborev queues a reminder by repository lineage and
trigger type. The next Hermes `Stop` delivers one reminder, ordered by failed
reviews before commits and then creation time. Hermes acquires fix-session
ownership only when that Stop event delivers the reminder.

Queued reminders retain the absolute triggering worktree and tell the agent to
change to it before running review commands, even if the session changed
directories or used `git -C`. Delivery waits until that worktree is back on the
triggering branch, or the exact triggering commit for a detached checkout, so
the fallback commands query the intended lineage. Repeated triggers coalesce
without losing their original queue position. Failed-review reminders are
rechecked before delivery and discarded if the reviews have been resolved.
Commit reminders receive the same recheck, so no queued reminder is delivered
after its failed reviews are resolved.

### Cursor

Cursor sends the same normalized events, thresholds, and accounting requests as
every other profile. Kit v0.14.0 cannot encode control output for Cursor's
post-tool or stop boundaries, so roborev always emits an empty Cursor response.
Because Cursor cannot receive the fix or completion instructions, its events do
not acquire fix-session ownership.

## Snoozing Reminders

Silence Agent Hook reminders temporarily when a session needs a longer stretch
of implementation work:

```bash
roborev snooze                 # defaults to eight hours
roborev snooze on --duration 2h
roborev snooze off             # resume immediately
```

The snooze is scoped to the current linked worktree and branch. Switching
branches or working in another checkout does not inherit it. Reviews continue to
enqueue and failed reviews keep accumulating; only the coding-agent reminder is
muted. Hook baselines advance while snoozed, avoiding a catch-up reminder for
every commit made during the quiet period.

Run `roborev status` to list every active snooze with its exact repository,
worktree, branch, and expiry. When the TUI is launched from a snoozed checkout
with automatic repository and branch filters enabled, its title shows the snooze
deadline. Clearing or changing either filter hides the badge because the view no
longer identifies that exact snooze scope.

The bundled `/roborev-snooze` skill (or `$roborev-snooze` in Codex) exposes both
the `on` and `off` operations from an agent session.

## Configuration

Set the top-level global `fix_guidelines` value when agents should validate
review suggestions against a standing policy before editing:

```toml
fix_guidelines = """
Treat review findings as hypotheses. Verify each one against the code and
project requirements. Explain findings that are intentionally not applied.
"""
```

Roborev appends this policy to triggered reminders after the profile's complete
instruction and continuation text. It also reaches direct, batch, and
commit-retry prompts from foreground `roborev fix`. An empty value keeps the
current automatic behavior unchanged.

`fix_guidelines` belongs only in the standard global config. It is separate from
the profile `instruction`, which remains a full replacement for workflow text.
If `agent-hook run --config` selects another file for thresholds or instruction,
fix guidelines still come from the standard global config.

All profiles except Factory Droid use `[agent_hook]` in the global config:

```toml
[agent_hook]
turn_threshold = 5
commit_threshold = 0
failed_review_threshold = 4
instruction = "Resolve open roborev findings now."
```

| Trigger | Default | TOML key | `run` flag | Environment variable |
|---------|---------|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Stop hooks | `5` | `turn_threshold` | `--turn-threshold` | `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_TURN_THRESHOLD` |
| Commits | `0` | `commit_threshold` | `--commit-threshold` | `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_COMMIT_THRESHOLD` |
| Open failed reviews | `4` | `failed_review_threshold` | `--failed-review-threshold` | `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_FAILED_REVIEW_THRESHOLD` |
| Instruction | self-contained fix workflow | `instruction` | `--instruction` | `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_INSTRUCTION` |
| Main daemon address | runtime discovery | | `--roborev-server` | `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_ROBOREV_ADDR` |

Factory Droid keeps `[droid_hook]` and the existing `ROBOREV_DROID_HOOK_*`
environment variables. Its default instruction is now the same self-contained
workflow as every other profile.

Set a threshold to `0` to disable that trigger. Resolution order is:

```text
run flags > environment variables > profile config section > defaults
```

`--roborev-server` and `ROBOREV_AGENT_HOOK_ROBOREV_ADDR` select the regular
roborev daemon used by the hook callback. Address overrides are operational and
are not persisted in TOML. Fix-session instructions preserve the resolved
override in their `fix-done` command.

## Inspecting Sessions

Status includes counters and queued Hermes reminders for every profile:

```bash
roborev agent-hook status
```

Resetting a session clears its queued reminders and any fix session owned by
that harness session. Resetting all sessions clears all fix-session state:

```bash
roborev agent-hook reset <session-id>
roborev agent-hook reset --all
```

These commands use the regular roborev daemon; there is no separate Agent Hook
process to manage.
